  <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
  Launched in: <i>2022</i>
  <br><br>
  The workers in the unorganized sector constitute about 93% of the total work force in the country. The Government has
  been implementing some social security measures for certain occupational groups but the coverage is miniscule.
  Majority of the workers are still without any social security coverage.
  <br><br>
  One of the major insecurities for workers in the unorganized sector is the frequent incidences of illness and need for
  medical care and hospitalization of such workers and their family members. Despite the expansion in the health
  facilities, illness remains one of the most prevalent causes of human deprivation in India.
